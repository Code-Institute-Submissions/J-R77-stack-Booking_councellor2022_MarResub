# About

Users can view the site in the usual way by navigating through the pages to learn more about the business. Users can view the Home, About, Services, Contact and Blog pages. The blog has not been set up yet so the users can sign up for an email for when it will be live. As well as this the User is able to create an account and then book, edit or delete appointments with the councellor. The User cannot use this service unless they have signed up for an account. Once signed in the User can view all their appointments using the My appointments link that appears in the nav bar. Site Admin Users can also create, edit and delete bookings in the Admin panel.

  The site is fully responsive by using the Bootstrap Greyscale Theme. All features get resized correctly except for the appointment table in view_appointment.html when viewed on a mobile. However one is able to slide across to view and also tilt the device to look in landcape mode.

  The site is easy to navigate by using the navbar.
